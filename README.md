# NAS
Neuron Simulator and Analyzer

This repository has been used for testing only. In a near future, the project can be restarted.

An important alert is "don't use any result from this project on your works", because there is no garanty that results are consistent in this version.

With that said, if you want to execute NAS, just run the file "nas_gui 1.m".

Some statementes may be helpful at this point:
-> This is for testing purpose only (just remembering)
-> This version is working on Matlab 2018b and wasn't tested yet on newer versions.
-> NAS may simulate multicompartmental neuron models. So, depending on your PC and on the simulation parameters, it could take a considerable amount of time to finish.
-> From the givem examples of neurons, only "burke neurons" are available for testing. However, you can import any neuron from Neuromorpho.org (.swc file).
